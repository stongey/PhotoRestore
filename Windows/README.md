STANDALONE WINDOWS APP FOR RESTORING FADED SLIDES AND PRINTS

NOTE - This is an experimental (alpha) release that has been tested only on Windows 7, so far.

Your experience may vary. Please report issues. 

-----

The instructions for running the program are:

• Make a new working folder anywhere on your computer.
• Copy (not move) into it some of the faded pictures you want to restore.
• In the working folder, make a subfolder named ’restored’ (without the ’ ’ quotes) to contain the results.
• Download the file restore4.0A.exe from GitHub.
• Copy it into the working directory.
• Double click on the program restore4.0A.exe.

Put the kettle on - the calculation is very slow but the results should appear in the ’restored’ directory.
It has been tested on Windows 7; I have no idea if it will work in Windows 10.

When viewing the resulting images using the default Windows image viewer, they appear dark and saturated. This appears to be caused by the Windows image viewer not the restoration software. They images look all right with other viewing software.
